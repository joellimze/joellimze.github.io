The following projects reflect nascent forays into the world of data science, upon completing an immersive course with General Assembly. 

I look forward to learning more about the field, and how its tools might be utilised to improve the welfare of communities in need - within and beyond Singapore.

> <b>A Model of HDB Resale Prices - Key Features & Insights</b>

Working closely with wonderful teammates, a hypothesis-driven, inference-focused regression model with extensively engineered features (e.g., proximity to brand-name schools) was built to identify key features associated with higher/lower resale prices. In addition, the model was found to to predict prices well (within ~ ± 8.5% of their transacted value). The application of regression regularisation techniques was further explored, to assess their potential to improve the model’s generalisability.

Working individually, identification of a broadcaster’s and audience’s sentiments were explored via video and text-analysis. While emotion profiles could be mapped via facial expression-emotion recognition modelling, topic-based sentiment analysis was identified as a valuable area for further research.
