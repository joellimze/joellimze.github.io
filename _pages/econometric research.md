The econometric research undertaken falls under the broad umbrella of development economics - and focuses on the employment, health, educational, environmental and gender-based challenges experienced by vulnerable communities within developing Asia. 

Apart from attempting to better understand these communities' difficulties, the effects of government policies intended to improve their welfare has also been of interest - with quasi-experimental econometric methods being employed as an analytical tool.

The Effect of Language Training on Immigrants’ Integration: Does the Duration of Training Matter? <i>Journal of Economic Behaviour & Organisation </i>, 212, 160-198 [[link]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268123001816)

This paper examines the influence of language training’s duration on immigrants’ labour market outcomes in relation to France’s Contrat d’Accueil et d’Intégration programme. Utilising a difference-in-differences (DiD) and matching-DiD approach, we find that longer training duration improves immigrants’ job quality, with more effective conveyance of knowledge on labour market institutions and an expansion of social networks being mediating mechanisms. While these effects are more pronounced among immigrants with more formal education and lower baseline French proficiency, they unfortunately do not accrue to refugees.

This paper seeks to understand causes of a peculiar association between the Philippines’ Pantawid Pamilyang CCT programme’s introduction and increased prevalence of underweighting, as detected via the country’s community-level nutrition surveillance system. Our findings suggest this was due to improvements in growth monitoring coverage, in line with the CCT’s demand-stimulating conditionalities. We further investigate if supply-side improvements were a key contributary factor, given the Philippines’ devolved healthcare system where goal alignment between central and local authorities may not be assured.
